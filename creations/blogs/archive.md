## Hoarding vs. Archiving
I recently came across a recurring problem: the tabs on my Safari app maxed out.. at 500 tabs. 
So I performed my usual routine of sorting through the tabs, filtering out idle pages and one-time
links. Scrolling through this sea of pages acts like a time-capsule for me, tracing conversations, 
tickets, and, most importantly, unknown references that past me saved for the future me to
remember. But with time, the tabs I crown worthy enough to remain start accumulating,
increasing the frequency with which I'm faced with this kerfuffle.

Unlike my phone, my computer does not give me the freedom to bestow judgment upon which
tabs deserve a nesting place atop my header. Instead, the application will simply
stop responding, forcing me to restart the entire system and accept the loss that comes with it.

My tabs were important to me. They are an archive of my interests over the years. Regardless
of whether I return to learn more about my saved topic or use a tool I thought helpful, I like 
having them. Owning them. Believing that one day, something will be done with the information they
store.

But at what point does archival become hoarding? Storage was the sole reason I made myself
a webpage back in 2021. To have my own space over which I have full control to store any information
I find interesting, or hope to find interesting in the future. It's a reflection of my past present and
future self. 

At this moment, I have a document containing 1,172 unique links, each containing its own set of 
hyperlinks and references and resources and etc. etc. The more clutter, the easier things get lost, 
and the less meaning each individual item holds. But that is what the world wide web is for!!! I would hold the same sentiment if I were in a library, 
though no one would argue against the notion that literature, and its preservation, serves a crucial
role in our society, past and present.

But can there be such a thing as too much.. *stuff*? I struggle with the balance of breadth and depth,
I get too excited exploring, resulting in a surface understanding of a vast array of subjects 
without real expertise in any. 

Like everything, it is all about balance. Deep web dives, archives, and collections tickle something in my brain, 
and as long as they don't cause too much distraction, I prefer to keep my clutter confined to html's. (Though I
can't put too much blame on my iPhone 12 mini for its poor performance and weak battery)
