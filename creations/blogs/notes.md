> “mappings” in our physical space where objects go through augmentations similar to compression / dimensionality reduction. Object can:
> - remain 3D (through mirror)
> - become 2D (through a webcam)
> - become 2D but with minimal features (shadow)  
> 
> Shadow - lowest level representation w object still be recognizable (latent space)
But.. they are different mediums of what..?  
>  Mirror is to information as shadow is to degree of intensity  
> 
>  Both a mirror and a shadow can represent a “mapping” of an object in the physical space, but cannot do so simultaneously since mirror requires light, while shadow requires the absence of it. 
> - Can they coexist in a physical space digitally ?
> 
> Maybe a screen where a shadow should be, and acting as a mirror? Or a screen within a mirror that illuminates only the figure cutout while keeping the rest dark.

<br>

>*05 - 01 - 25*  
> I hate unemployed life  
> I should look into volunteering  
I dont want to create anything or do anything  
I need to watch more movies  
I am doing things that should make me happy, but they dont and I feel guilty about it  
I have friends now, they are lovely, but I have to force myself to see them  
The whole time im waiting to go home  
I dont want to meet new people because I already miss so many and it’s hard to be connected to everyone  
I dont talk to my parents because of job hunt  
I am so depressed and miserable all the time  
I dont want anything  
Nothing makes me happy  
Nothing brings me joy  
I dread doing anything  
Seeing people doesn’t fix anything  
Meeting people is a drag  
I am a shell of myself  
I am so boring and so bored and I dont know how to get myself out of it  
Home is fake and won’t solve my problems  
Nothing will  
Society is f-ed up  

I had a rough day ^ I was over it in the morning

> **Oyster sales - shucker- retail seafood market**  
> Hello, I just applied for the position of oyster sales. I have not worked in the seafood industry but have experience in the general food industry. My past coworkers have described me as a fast learner, a hard worker, and tidy. I think I could be a valuable addition to your team, look forward to hearing from you!

The message that got me a job as an Oyster Shucker with no experience haha

> Quote of the day: be ok with not knowing
> 
> Why must I work to be healthy and sane
> 
> rejection is the core root of (almost) every negative emotion. in my opinion the truest
negative emotions are jealousy, grief, and fear. any interpersonal issues stem from jealousy,
grief comes from uncontrollable loss, and fear is a survival mechanism.
>
> i should not live alone..  
too much death anxiety and i can’t sleep/eat/work when I’m alone
