Sunday, September 15th, 2024. A beautiful day in my new neighborhood, and a beautiful new farmers market for my roomie and me to explore. As per usual, I grab my shoulder bag before heading out. Heavy? Maybe.. But it’s the price I pay for having all my necessities at hand, in case of emergency of course.

In the bag were:

- Full bottle of Giorgio Armani Perfume
- 2 Printed photos of a young Adrien Brody
- Geometric earrings I “borrowed” from my mother
- A small notebook
- A tiny plastic baby lamb
- And my MacBook Air

Upon arrival, we realized the market has already closed down, but we decided 
to take a stroll around anyway. Given the brevity of our excursion I re-evaluated 
my decision to bring my cumbersome bag, and after a brief pep-talk with myself I 
decided that I was being overprotective of my baby and that a moment away would 
be a good opportunity for me to face the separation anxiety I have developed with
my computer. As a computer scientist, it had become an extension of me. Work and 
pleasure sat in the comfort of the device that represented all my years of education, 
research, leisure, and entertainment. Complex codebases, all constructed from pieces 
of one another in a system that only I and the computer were privy to. My world. My 
identity. Nonetheless, I was aware of my codependent relationship with this gadget, 
and recognized its drawbacks, so I secured it in my bag, and tucked it discreetly under 
the backseat of my car, and wandered away.

The walk around the park was very pleasant, and it was nice seeing people enjoying the
outdoors, but with not much else left to do, we circled back to the parked car. Within 
the 30 minutes we were out, I had already begun feeling my anxiety creeping up and 
wanted to check in on my pride and joy. But as we approached, the anxiety quickly 
manifested into shock, and then quickly into dread, as I noticed a pile of black shards
on the concrete next to the car. Seeing the gaping hole in my window pane reflected in 
an almost physiological discomfort, as if someone had ripped a part of myself off of my
body. But surprisingly, this was all I felt. Having lost what I considered to be my life’s
work, I seemingly surpassed all stages of grief and found an unexpected tranquility concerning 
the situation. Assessing my options, all I could do was hope that the burglar would have some 
sympathy for the rest of my material possessions and not discard them at the nearest convenience.

I found it difficult to convey the magnitude of the loss to others and was confronted 
with the seemingly obvious “hindsight” of the precautions I *didn’t* take. Consolations were 
inevitably coupled with a variation of fault or blame, with advice on what I should have done
to prevent this.

The shock and turmoil never hit me as I thought it would, and all I was left with was the 
confrontation with the futility of things, whether it be material or emotional. I recovered 
my work up to the start of my graduate studies, but still mourn the year of work I felt most
proud of in my research. Starting anew had its benefits too, like unlearning my habits of 
recycling code which could, in theory, be written better. All that to say, make the most of 
what you have, and use this as a reminder to backup your systems :) (though I know you will 
probably put it off the same way I did…)
